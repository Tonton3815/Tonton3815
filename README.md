- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tonton3815
Retired racing man.
My project is to have some help and also give my knowledge.
My target : engine with 600 HP/L and 16 k Rpm with normal fuel 95.
Using two different system in one, never done.
I didn't know all that is ECU, and I believe that dead zone and Rpm on injector is not easy.
If french possible, thank.
